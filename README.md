# Project Seeder

Project Seeder is a development tool designed to deliver a fully-featured web application right from the start. It aims to streamline the development process by integrating essential components that often require additional setup and configuration.

You'll get a complete app boilerplate and will be able to focus on your app's logic from the get-go!

## What is included
Your application includes server-side rendering (SSR) to enhance performance and boost search engine optimization without any additional setup. The integrated state management system ensures seamless data flow within your app, allowing you to focus on building features rather than dealing with complex state configurations.

Enjoy the convenience of a simple routing system and a built-in API wrapper which facilitates easy connection to various backend services, streamlining data fetching and integration.

Additionally, we've included a UI library and a predefined layout, saving you time on styling and providing a collection of pre-designed components that adhere to modern design principles.

With Project Seeder, developers can kickstart their projects with a solid foundation, eliminating the need for manual integration of crucial tools and libraries.
